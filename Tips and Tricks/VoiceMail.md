One thing you will notice when an outbound call is picked up by an answering machine or voice mail, the twilio will just start talking while the answering message is going on.  This can cause some parts of the outbound message to not be recorded.  There is an additional service to attempt to detect an answering machine, however there is another approach.  Doing a continuous Gather until no sound is received can delay the message to wait for the answering machine to actually be recording.
