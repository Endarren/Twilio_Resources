# How to use Voice tag properly?

Tags for modifying how the voice says text can be used in one of two ways.  
* The first is by inserting the tags and the text they surround into the say as text, using AddText.

* The second is to append them on as children using Append.
Which method you should use depends on the vocie you are using.  If the voice is an Amazon Polly voice, then use Append.  Otherwise, use AddText.
